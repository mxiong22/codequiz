## Challenge 4: Create a timed quiz on javascript fundamentals that stores high scores. 
## The motivation of this project is to create a timed mutiple choice quiz that shows the count down timer on the screen, and the user is presented with another question if the answer is correct, but if the answer is incorrect, time will be taken off of the clock. Once the timer ends, the user can then see their quiz results and enter their name into the highscore board. 
- This project needed to be solved by using javaScript to set a timer interval that would be running continuosly while user is answering the quiz questions. 
- I learned that creating an interactive page with a self timer, and logging information is very difficult.
